Installation of the Monkey-Spider:

At first the requierements have to be installed and configured properly:

* Heritrix http://crawler.archive.org
* PostgreSQL http://postgresql.org
* ClamAV http://www.clamav.net
* PyGreSQL http://www.pygresql.org
* SOAPpy http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net
* pYsearch http://pysearch.sourceforge.net

After that it has to be ensured that the Heritrix binaries are executable and 
in the PATH environment Variable:

 For example if heritrix was installed in /opt/:

 chmod +x /opt/heritrix-1.12.1/bin/*
 echo PATH=$PATH:/opt/heritrix-1.12.1/bin >> ~/.bashrc 
 echo export PATH >> ~/.bashrc 

After that the Monkey-Spider configuration file monkey-spider.conf in etc/ has 
to be copied or linked to /etc/monkey-spider.conf.

After that the bin/ folder for monkey-spider has to be added to the system path 
like for Heritrix above:
 
 For example if monkey-spider was copied to /opt/:

 echo PATH=$PATH:/opt/monkey-spider/bin >> ~/.bashrc 
 echo export PATH >> ~/.bashrc

That's it.
