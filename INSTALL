Installation of the Monkey-Spider:

At first the requierements have to be installed and configured properly:

* Heritrix http://crawler.archive.org (1.x or 2.x works with both)
* PostgreSQL http://postgresql.org
* ClamAV http://www.clamav.net
* PyGreSQL http://www.pygresql.org
* SOAPpy http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net (for MSN/Live search)
* pYsearch http://pysearch.sourceforge.net (for Yahoo)

It has to be ensured that the Heritrix binaries are executable and 
in the PATH environment Variable:

 To test this the command: 
 which heritrix
 should output the folder where heritrix is installed in. If nothing appears 
 follow the example below.

 For example if heritrix was installed in /opt/:

 chmod +x /opt/heritrix-1.12.1/bin/*
 echo PATH=$PATH:/opt/heritrix-1.12.1/bin >> ~/.bashrc 
 echo export PATH >> ~/.bashrc 

To install the monkey-spider version 0.2 run the install.sh script as root.
To uninstall run uninstall.sh.

Additionally the database scheme for the malware database has to be committed
 to the database. It is located in 
/usr/share/monkeyspider/examples/mw-db-scheme.sql and can be commited 
with the command: 

psql -f mw-db-scheme.sql malwaredb

That's it.
