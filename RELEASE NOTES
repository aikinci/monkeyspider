Release notes for Monkey-Spider version 0.1
===========================================

This is the first public release of the Monkey-Spider system. The scripts are 
working stable but there hasn't been yet an in deep testing of them by others.

Unsolved Issues:
 -  The ms-seeder-mail-pop3 script is not yet able to extract links out of crawled
    mails. A regular expression matching has to be implemented for this issue.
 -  The ms-scanner-clamav script is not using all three tables of the database
    but only one. That leads to an insufficient data storage in the databas regarding
    the version information of the used malware scanner provided in the table
    mw_scanner holding the name the program version and the signature version of
    the malware scanner which has the detected the malware sample and the table 
    mw_output which holds the particular name which might be unique to a certain
    malware scanner and/or program version of such. This might not be a big problem
    in the first place because at least the malware name is still stored in the
    comment column inside of the first used malware table. This will be fixed in 
    any of the later versions.
